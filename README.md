## Project: Link shortener

1. Api should be authorised , means it will be not an open api, use any Jwt or simple authentication techniques.

2. create Api which takes long url , store it and convert it to short url like

https://google.com/api/user/a=1233?&9097?api-ref=iadiwkwn

convert into https://local:3000/xhjeko

3. when https://local:3000/xhjeko this url is used it redirected to back its original url

4. also count click on particular link. like https://local:3000/xhjeko if opened 3 times , click_count = 3
